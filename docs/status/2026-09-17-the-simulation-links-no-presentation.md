### The simulation links no presentation, 2026-09-17

**Proved on every platform.** CI run 35199507565 (commit `c88b7f0`) passed all
11 tests in every preset, including the binary check reading `otool -L` on
macOS and `dumpbin /dependents` under both MSVC and clang-cl. The check fails
when it finds no dependencies at all, so a pass means each reader understood its
tool's output. Before that run it had been proved on Linux only.

`cmake/Layering.cmake` holds three checks.

**Includes, at configure time.** `glideslope_check_layering` reads every source
under `src/sim/` — `.h .hh .hpp .hxx .inl .ipp .c .cc .cpp .cxx`, recursively —
line by line, and refuses an `#include` of SDL's umbrella or entry-point headers
(3), its video headers (23), its input headers (12) or its audio header, taken
from `include/SDL3` at release-3.4.16, or of anything under `gfx/`, `ui/`,
`platform/` or `frontend/`, with or without leading `../`. The refusal names the
file, the line number and the line, for example
`src/sim/version.cpp:2: #include <SDL3/SDL_gamepad.h>    <- includes SDL
presentation (SDL_gamepad.h)`. SDL's non-presentation headers — threads,
atomics, timers — are not refused by this check. The text is read with `;`,
`[` and `]` swapped out first, because CMake lists split on the first and stop
splitting inside the other two, and C++ is full of all three.

**Links, at configure time.** `glideslope_check_sim_links` walks everything
`glideslope_sim` links — `LINK_LIBRARIES` and `INTERFACE_LINK_LIBRARIES`,
through aliases and `$<LINK_ONLY:...>`, recursively — and refuses any SDL3
target, library name or library file. It is scheduled with
`cmake_language(DEFER)` so a `target_link_libraries` anywhere later in
`CMakeLists.txt` is still seen. This is stricter than the include check: SDL is
one library, and linking any of it links its video, input and audio code.

**The binary, at test time.** `tests/cmake/binary_dependencies.cmake` reads
the dynamic dependencies recorded in `glideslope_cli` itself and refuses any of
26 Linux, 16 macOS or 18 Windows windowing, graphics, input and audio libraries,
SDL included. It fails, rather than passing, if it finds no dependencies at all,
because that means the reader stopped understanding the tool's output. On Linux
today the CLI depends on `libstdc++.so.6`, `libm.so.6`, `libgcc_s.so.1` and
`libc.so.6`.

**Tests:**

- `every_forbidden_include_in_the_simulation_fails_the_configure` — 64 cases,
  derived from the lists and counted: every forbidden SDL header (39); every
  layer as `"layer/x.hpp"`, `"../layer/x.hpp"` and `<layer/x.hpp>` (12); every
  scanned extension (10); a subdirectory, `#  include`, and an include after a
  line holding an unclosed `[` and a `;` (3). Each must be refused naming the
  file, line 3, and the include.
- `includes_that_only_look_like_presentation_are_allowed_in_the_simulation` —
  allowed SDL headers, `sim/` and `world/` headers, `gfxtools/`, `uikit.hpp`,
  `platforms/`, a commented-out forbidden include, one in a block comment, and
  one inside a string, all in one file that must be accepted.
- `sdl_linked_into_the_simulation_by_any_route_fails_the_configure` — 7 cases
  in `tests/layering_link/`: SDL linked directly, through a public dependency,
  through a private one, through an interface library, by plain library name,
  and by file path must each be refused; a simulation linking only non-SDL
  targets must be accepted.
- `the_cli_links_the_simulation_and_nothing_presentational` — the binary check
  on `glideslope_cli`.

**Watched to fail, seven ways**, all locally. In the real tree: a
`#include <SDL3/SDL_gamepad.h>` added to `src/sim/version.cpp` stopped the
configure naming `src/sim/version.cpp:2`; a `target_link_libraries` of
`SDL3::SDL3` into `glideslope_sim` appended to the end of `CMakeLists.txt`
stopped it naming the route; and linking the CLI against ALSA failed the binary
test naming `libasound.so.2`. In the checkers: matching only `::SDL3` failed the
library-name and file-path cases; removing the recursion failed the three
indirect cases; removing the `../` normalisation failed all four `../layer`
cases; and removing the `[` escaping failed the unclosed-bracket case.

Verified on Rocky Linux 10 with GCC 14.3.1: `linux-debug` and `linux-release`
each pass 11 of 11 tests, and every configure prints
`src/sim/ includes no presentation (2 files)` and
`glideslope_sim links no SDL`.
