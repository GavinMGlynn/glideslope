### A fixed 120 Hz step, 2026-09-17

**Proved on every platform.** CI run 35216463701 (commit `1d2649c`) passed all
20 tests in every preset — GCC 14.2 on Ubuntu (sanitized and release) and Rocky
9, AppleClang 17 (sanitized and release), MSVC 19.51 (debug and release) and
clang-cl 20.1 — so the five differently-chunked flights ended in identical
states on each. Before that run it had been proved on Linux only.

`glideslope::sim::FixedStep` turns elapsed time into whole 120 Hz steps.
**The steps taken depend only on the total time elapsed**, never on how it was
divided: time is held in whole nanoseconds, and the steps due are computed from
the total each time, split into whole and part seconds so nothing overflows for
the 292 years an int64 of nanoseconds lasts. `alpha()` is how far the time since
the last step has got towards the next, for interpolation.

`glideslope::sim::Aircraft` now also takes initial conditions (position,
altitude, terrain elevation, heading, calibrated airspeed, engine running),
controls (elevator, aileron, rudder, throttle, mixture, flaps, brakes), steps
once per call with JSBSim's time step set to exactly 1/120 s, and reports its
state (time, position, attitude, body velocities and rates, calibrated
airspeed, climb rate, engine RPM). Positive elevator is stick back; JSBSim's own
command is the other way round, and the wrapper turns it over.

**A unit-test harness**, `tests/unit/harness.hpp`, is new: a registry of named
test functions in one executable, `glideslope_tests`, run one test per ctest.
`every_compiled_unit_test_is_registered_with_ctest` compares the executable's
`--list` with the names given to ctest, both ways, because a test compiled and
never registered would never run and nothing would say so.

**Tests, 20 now:**

- `the_fixed_step_counts_steps_from_the_total_time_alone` — 11 ways of dividing
  time (1 µs, 1 ms, 16 ms, 33 ms, a 60 Hz and a 144 Hz frame rounded to the
  nanosecond, one step less a nanosecond, 100 ms, 1 s, uneven chunks of 0 to 50
  ms, and all at once), each over 1 s and over 10 s. After *every* advance the
  steps taken must equal the steps in the time fed so far, as computed by the
  standard library's own ratio arithmetic, and the advance must have returned
  the difference.
- `the_fixed_step_reports_how_far_it_is_into_the_next_step` — 10.004 s is
  1200 steps and 0.48 of the next; 4,333,333 ns more is a third of a nanosecond
  short of completing it, and one nanosecond more completes it.
- `the_fixed_step_refuses_time_running_backwards`.
- `the_fixed_step_counts_a_century_without_overflowing` — 36,525 days,
  3.156e18 ns, whose steps would overflow if multiplied naively.
- `a_flight_fed_its_time_in_any_chunks_ends_in_the_same_state` — a Cessna over
  Sydney at 3,000 ft and 100 kt, flown for ten seconds by a script that is a
  function of the step number alone (throttle, a slow elevator sine, an aileron
  and a rudder input), with its time arriving in 1 ms, 16 ms, 100 ms and uneven
  chunks and all at once. All five must take 1200 steps and end in exactly the
  same state, compared field by field with `==`. The test also requires the
  flight to have rolled and the engine to be running, so the flights cannot
  agree by all doing nothing.
- `the_elevator_pulled_back_pitches_the_nose_up` — and pushed forward, down.
- `every_compiled_unit_test_is_registered_with_ctest`.

**Watched to fail, five ways.** Counting steps by adding up floating-point
fractions of a step failed the fixed-step test ("16 ms: after 400000000 ns, 47
steps taken, 48 due") and the flight test ("16 ms: took 1199 steps"). The first
version of the fixed-step test checked only the final count and **passed** that
same bug; it was changed to check after every advance and to include 16 ms and
33 ms chunks, and only then failed it. Setting the controls once per chunk of
time instead of once per step failed the flight test ("16 ms: ended in a
different state from 1 ms"). Reversing the elevator's sign failed the elevator
test. Leaving a compiled test out of the ctest list failed the registration
test.

**Verified locally:** `linux-release` and the sanitized `linux-debug` each pass
20 of 20. The flight test's five ten-second flights take about 0.04 s in
release and 1.9 s sanitized.
