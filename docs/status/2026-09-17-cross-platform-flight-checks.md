### Cross-platform flight checks, 2026-09-17

**The platforms fly identically, to the precision they print.** CI run
35223462224 (commit `29ed2f3`) compared the five release builds for the first
time: every one of the nine figures agreed to its two printed decimals on GCC
on Ubuntu and Rocky 9, AppleClang, MSVC and clang-cl — a spread of zero against
the 1% allowed — and the five-minute selftest ended at -34.1073165, 151.2320529,
1,537.3 ft, heading 335.73°, 110.33 KCAS on all five.

**The hashes still differ**, as they were designed to be allowed to: Linux GCC
prints `3bf3106980a5ad7b` (the same on Ubuntu and Rocky 9), MSVC and clang-cl
both `d9a3d51b8c2cdd52`, AppleClang `6d19773416ce7b3f`. So does the development
machine's own release build (`13253df30045304a`, GCC 14.3.1) from CI's GCC 14.2
release build, while CI's matches the development machine's sanitized build.
The bits differ somewhere in five minutes of flight; where the aircraft is, to
seven decimal places, does not.

**The tolerances, set before any cross-platform number was seen:** every one of
the nine published figures within 1% of its published value across all five
release builds, ten times tighter than the handbook ranges; and the five-minute
selftest ending within 300 ft horizontally, 30 ft vertically, 1 kt and 2° of
heading of the first platform's. The selftest's hash is not compared: the
machines are expected to differ in the last bits.

**How.** Each CI job now runs `glideslope_cli figures c172p` and
`glideslope_cli selftest` on its release build — GCC on Ubuntu and on Rocky 9,
AppleClang, MSVC and clang-cl — and uploads what they print. A new job, "The
same flights everywhere", needs all four jobs, downloads the five results, and
runs `tests/cmake/cross_platform_flights.cmake`, which names the five platforms
and fails if any is missing.

**Its test** makes five platforms from this build's own output. Identical, with
one platform's climb rate 0.3% higher, they must be accepted; a glide ratio 1.9%
higher on one, the selftest ending 400 ft north on one, and one platform's
figures missing must each be refused. **Watched to fail for the right reasons:**
the first version of the test moved the glide ratio from 9.38 to 956 instead of
9.56, and the check refused it — correctly, but for a gross error rather than
the 2% it claimed to test. With the arithmetic fixed, each refusal's message
names the glide ratio's platforms, the 400 ft, and the missing platform. The
test is
`the_cross_platform_check_accepts_platforms_that_agree_and_refuses_one_that_does_not`.
