### Positions on the Earth, 2026-09-17

**Proved on every platform** by CI run 35223462224 (commit `29ed2f3`), which
passed all 45 tests in every preset. Nothing uses the conversions yet — the
simulation keeps JSBSim's positions, and there is no renderer or terrain.

`glideslope_world` is a new library, and `src/world/geodesy.hpp` its first
file: `Ecef` (double-precision metres, Earth-centred and Earth-fixed),
`Geodetic` (latitude, longitude, height above the ellipsoid), and the
conversions between them on WGS84. The forward conversion is the exact formula;
the inverse is Vermeille's closed form (2004), with no iteration.

**Tests:**

- `wgs84_reference_points_convert_exactly` — the equator at 0°, 90° E and 180°,
  both poles (100 m above the South Pole at an arbitrary longitude), and the
  derived semi-minor axis against WGS84's published 6,356,752.314245 m.
- `geodetic_positions_round_trip_through_ecef_within_a_millimetre` — 819
  positions, counted: 13 latitudes (both poles exactly and a ten-millionth of a
  degree away, the equator exactly and a billionth either side), 9 longitudes
  (both sides of the date line, the prime meridian), and 7 heights from 430 m
  below sea level to 40 km. Latitude and longitude must come back within a
  billionth of a degree and the position within a millimetre; the worst was
  3.4 nanometres.
- `the_geodetic_conversion_agrees_with_jsbsims_within_a_millimetre` — the same
  819 positions converted back by JSBSim's `FGLocation`, a different algorithm
  set up with JSBSim's own WGS84 axes in feet, not this project's constants.

**Watched to fail, three ways:** a spherical Earth in the forward conversion
failed the reference and round-trip tests; one term dropped from the inverse's
height failed the round-trip and JSBSim tests; and a flattening of 1/298.26
instead of 1/298.257223563 failed the reference test and — once the JSBSim
check used JSBSim's own axes rather than this project's — the JSBSim test too.

**Verified locally:** `linux-release` passes 45 of 45.
