### SDL3, a GPU device, and a frame, 2026-09-17 — Vulkan on Linux only

**What is missing first:** only Vulkan has drawn a frame, on Linux, through
Mesa's lavapipe on the CPU. Direct3D 12 and Metal have never created a device;
CI tries them with this commit, on runners that have no GPU, and may not be able
to. No test opens a window: every frame so far is headless. The frame is the
sky's clear colour and nothing else.

**What exists.** `ext/sdl` is SDL 3.4.16, built statically by
`cmake/Sdl.cmake`. `glideslope_gfx` is a new library: `gfx::Renderer` owns an
SDL_GPU device on the driver asked for, or SDL's choice, renders into a 1280x720
(or `--size`) colour target cleared to the sky, blits it to a window when there
is one, and reads a frame back off the GPU; `gfx::save_bmp` writes it.
`glideslope`, the client, is a new executable: `--headless` renders without a
window, `--gpu-driver` picks Vulkan, Direct3D 12 or Metal, `--shot FILE` and
`--shot-at FRAME` write a frame and exit. The simulation still links no SDL;
the layering checks still pass.

**The test** — `the_client_renders_the_sky_headless_on_vulkan` on Linux, and
the same for `direct3d12` and `vulkan` on Windows and `metal` on macOS — runs
the client headless on that driver, requires it to report that driver, and
reads the BMP it wrote: header, bit masks, and all 3,072 pixels of a 64x48
frame, each channel within 1 of the sky times 255.

**Watched to fail:** a sky a shade greener failed with pixel 0's green at 168;
a render pass that loaded rather than cleared its target failed with red at 0.

CI now installs SDL's Linux development packages on Ubuntu and Rocky 9 (EPEL and
CRB on Rocky), and Mesa's lavapipe with the Vulkan loader.

**Verified locally:** `linux-release` passes 46 of 46; the frame test passes
under the sanitized `linux-debug` too, with no leak reports from SDL or Mesa.
