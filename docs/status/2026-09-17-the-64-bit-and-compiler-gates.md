### The 64-bit and compiler gates, 2026-09-17

`cmake/Platform.cmake` runs straight after `project()`. It refuses a toolchain
with pointers smaller than 8 bytes, and a compiler older than its floor —
GNU 14, Clang 19 (clang-cl included, which CMake reports as Clang),
AppleClang 16, MSVC 19.39 — with a message naming what it found and what it
needs; for GCC it also says how to enable gcc-toolset-14. A platform outside
Linux x86_64, Windows x64 and macOS arm64, or a compiler with no floor, is
warned about rather than refused. Every configure prints the resolved line, for
example `glideslope: linux-x86_64, GNU 14.3.1 (C++20)`.

The gate is written against `CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME` and does no `try_compile`, so
it runs in CMake script mode against a toolchain described by `-D` flags. That
is how it is tested, because no machine here has a 32-bit toolchain or an old
compiler to hand:

- `a_32_bit_toolchain_is_refused_on_every_platform` — 3 cases: Linux, Windows
  and macOS, each with 4-byte pointers, each refused with "64-bit only" and
  "4-byte pointers" in the output.
- `every_compiler_is_refused_below_its_floor_and_accepted_at_it` — 8 cases,
  derived from the floor table rather than listed in the test: each compiler one
  version below its floor is refused with the found and required versions named,
  and at its floor is accepted with the resolved line printed. The test counts
  the cases it walked against twice the size of the table.

**Watched to fail, four ways**, locally. Relaxing the pointer check to `LESS 4`
failed all three pointer-size cases. Comparing floors with `VERSION_LESS_EQUAL`
failed every at-floor case. Downgrading the refusal to a warning failed every
below-floor case. Adding a compiler to the table with no platform for the test
to run it on failed with "walked 8 cases, expected 10".

**And against a real old compiler:** CI's Rocky 9 job configures once with the
system's own `g++` and requires the configure to fail with "required: GNU 14 or
newer" before building with gcc-toolset-14. In CI run 35198316459 (commit
`7921839`, green in all four jobs) that compiler was `g++ (GCC) 11.5.0`, refused
with `found: GNU 11.5.0`.

The same commit makes the later preset steps in each CI job run even when an
earlier one failed, closing the gap the deliberately red run showed.

Verified on Rocky Linux 10 with GCC 14.3.1: `linux-debug` and `linux-release`
each pass 6 of 6 tests.
