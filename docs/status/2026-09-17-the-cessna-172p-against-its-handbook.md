### The Cessna 172P against its handbook, 2026-09-17

**Proved on every platform.** CI run 35219070877 (commit `e6b97eb`) passed all
34 tests in every preset — GCC 14.2 on Ubuntu and Rocky 9, AppleClang 17, MSVC
19.51 and clang-cl 20.1 — so all nine figures land in range on each, and the
`package` workflow (35219070739) passed with the tuned model in every package.
The handbook publishes no turn rate, so the turn is checked against physics
rather than a published number.

**JSBSim's own C172P did not fly to its handbook.** The checks below, flown on
JSBSim's untouched model at the same 2,400 lb, landed out of range on five of
nine, so the model was tuned — the question Phase 1 exists to ask. The tuning
is not hand-edited into the model: `tools/make_c172p.py` makes
`assets/jsbsim/` from the pinned files with each change listed and justified in
its docstring, and a test fails if the committed files differ from what it
makes.

| Figure | Handbook | Range | Stock JSBSim | glideslope |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Static RPM, full throttle | 2300 to 2420 | 2300 to 2420 | **2538** | 2316 |
| Take-off ground roll | 890 ft | ±10% | 940 | 922 |
| Climb, sea level, 76 KIAS | 700 ft/min | ±10% | **978** | 742 |
| Cruise, 8000 ft, 2650 RPM | 121 KTAS | ±3 kt | 123.1 | 119.7 |
| Glide, 65 KIAS, engine off | 9.1:1 | ±10% | 8.38 | 9.38 |
| Stall, flaps up | 51 to 52 KCAS | 49.5 to 54 | **54.4** | 51.1 |
| Stall, flaps 10 | 48 to 49 KCAS | 46 to 51 | **51.0** | 47.6 |
| Stall, flaps 30 | 46 KCAS | 44 to 48 | **48.8** | 45.6 |
| Turn, 30° bank | g·tan(bank)/V | ±3% | 98.8% | 99.0% |

The figures, their sources and their conditions are in
`assets/figures/c172p.xml`: every number is from the Cessna Model 172P Pilot's
Operating Handbook of 12 May 1981, by section and figure, with indicated
airspeeds converted to calibrated by its figure 5-1. The ranges are this
project's.

**What each change does**, measured by leaving it out and flying every check:

| Left out | Static RPM | Ground roll | Climb | Cruise | Glide |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| nothing | 2316 | 922 | 742 | 119.7 | 9.38 |
| propeller power and thrust factors | 2538 | 697 | 1147 | 121.5 | 9.38 |
| thrust boost below advance ratio 0.5 | 2316 | 1216 | 725 | 119.7 | 9.38 |
| drag changes | 2316 | 935 | 661 | 121.3 | 7.89 |

The stall speeds moved from 54.4, 51.0 and 48.8 KCAS to 51.1, 47.6 and 45.6 with
the lift-curve and flap-lift changes, which barely move anything else.

**How it was found.** A first prototype flew each figure and showed the
propeller over-revving (2,800 RPM in a full-throttle climb, past the 2,700 RPM
redline) and the stall limited by elevator travel rather than by the wing: the
elevator reached its stop at 16.5° angle of attack, at a lift coefficient of
1.45. The handbook's static RPM range, its airspeed calibration table and its
stall table then gave targets that separate the propeller from the airframe.
JSBSim's two other C172 models were flown too and were no closer: `c172x` glided
at 13:1 and `c172r` climbed at 905 ft/min against its handbook's 720.

**The flights** are in `src/sim/figures.cpp`, flown by a small test pilot — a
pitch-attitude hold with slower speed and altitude loops above it, a wing
leveller and a rudder that holds the sideslip at zero. It is not the Phase 4
autopilot and is not meant to fly like a person. A first version of its rudder
let the aircraft slip half a degree in the turn, which turned 2% slower than its
bank demanded; an integral took the slip out.

- **Static RPM:** brakes on, full throttle, mixture leaned in steps; the most
  RPM any mixture reaches.
- **Take-off:** flaps 10, full throttle against the brakes, released; ground
  distance until no wheel is on the ground, rotating at 55.6 KCAS (51 KIAS).
- **Climb:** full throttle at 75.4 KCAS (76 KIAS); the climb over forty seconds
  through sea level, after thirty to settle.
- **Cruise:** level at 8,000 ft, mixture leaned to the most RPM, then throttle
  holding 2,650 RPM; average true airspeed over the last fifty seconds of three
  minutes. It fails if the RPM cannot be held.
- **Glide:** mixture cut off, propeller windmilling, 66 KCAS (65 KIAS); ground
  distance over height lost across three minutes.
- **Stalls:** power off, from 70 KCAS the target speed falls one knot a second
  and the pilot follows it with the nose; the slowest calibrated airspeed.
- **Turn:** 30° bank level at 3,000 ft; the turn rate as a percentage of
  g·tan(bank)/true airspeed, both averaged over thirty seconds after a minute.

Every flight loads the aircraft as the figures file says and fails unless JSBSim
then weighs it at the file's 2,400 lb.

`glideslope::sim::Aircraft` gained `load()` and `property()`. The CLI gained
`glideslope_cli figures NAME [FIGURE]`, which prints each measurement against
its range and exits 1 if any is out. `assets/` is new: `assets/jsbsim/` (the
made model) and `assets/figures/`, copied to `data/` beside the programs; a
change to any file there now reconfigures, which `CONFIGURE_DEPENDS` alone had
not done — the first tuning run changed the assets and measured nothing new.

**Tests, 34 now:** one per figure —
`a_cessna_172p_at_full_power_climbs_near_its_published_rate` and eight like
it — plus
`every_published_figure_has_a_flight_and_every_flight_a_figure`,
`the_committed_cessna_172p_is_what_its_tuning_script_makes` (skipped, not
passed, where there is no Python 3), and CLI tests for one figure, a figure the
aircraft does not have, and an aircraft with no figures file.

**Watched to fail, six ways:** a hand edit to the committed model failed the
script check; writing the climb figure as 500 failed the climb test, naming the
measurement, the range and the source; a figure in the file with no flight, and
a flight in the code with no figure, each failed the coverage test; a loading
that came to 2,330 lb failed with the weight; and the stock propeller factors
failed the static RPM, take-off and climb tests.

**Verified locally:** `linux-release` passes 34 of 34, and the sanitized
`linux-debug` passes them too, the nine flights taking 44 of its 67 seconds.
