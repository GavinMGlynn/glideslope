### The selftest and its hash, 2026-09-17

**Proved on every platform.** CI run 35222154134 (commit `3a6ef0c`) passed all
41 tests in every preset, so on each the hash held run to run and moved when
the drag did; the `package` workflow (35222154187) passed too. The hash holds
on one build: the release and sanitized builds on the same machine print
different hashes, and different platforms are not expected to agree.

**The hash, and the rule that goes with it.** On the development machine
(Rocky Linux 10, GCC 14.3.1), `linux-release` prints
`hash 13253df30045304a` and `linux-debug` prints `hash 3bf3106980a5ad7b`. A
change that moves either is deliberate, and is written here with its reason.

`glideslope_cli selftest [NAME]` reads `assets/selftest/NAME.log` (default
`c172p`) and flies it: brake release with 10° of flap, rotation at 55.6 KCAS, a
climb at 75.4 KCAS, flaps up, a climbing turn at 20° of bank, levelling at
1,500 ft, a level turn at 25°, and cruise, for 300 s — 36,000 steps, 0.19 s in
release. After every step it folds sixteen fields of the aircraft's state into
a 64-bit FNV-1a hash, bit for bit, and prints the hash with where the flight
ended: at 1,537 ft, 110 KCAS, heading 336° for the development machine's
release build.

**The log is of pilot commands, not stick positions.** The first log held the
controls themselves — throttle, elevator, aileron — and the aircraft rotated,
rolled left, stalled and cartwheeled down the runway, over and over, for three
minutes: a stable aircraft cannot be flown open loop. The log now holds commands
(`throttle`, `flaps`, `brakes`, `rotate_at`, `hold_speed`, `hold_altitude`,
`bank`, `end`) that the test pilot flies, which is as fixed as the flight needs
to be and stays sensible when the model is retuned. On the ground the pilot now
steers along the starting heading: without it the take-off roll swerved 90°,
and a first version of the steering had its sign the wrong way round and spun
the aircraft on the runway, because this model's rudder yaws left for positive
commands.

`glideslope_cli` gained `--data DIR`, reading data from DIR instead of `data/`
beside the program.

**Tests, 41 now:**

- `the_selftest_prints_the_same_hash_every_run` — two runs, identical output.
- `a_one_line_change_to_the_physics_moves_the_selftest_hash` — the selftest
  flown on an unchanged copy of the data prints the same hash as the data
  itself, so `--data` really is read; on a copy whose zero-lift drag is 0.0311
  instead of 0.031 it prints a different one (`f7de68708bc9c1ce`).
- `a_selftest_log_with_a_command_it_does_not_know_is_refused_at_its_line`
- `the_cli_refuses_a_selftest_for_an_aircraft_with_no_log`

**Watched to fail:** adding the wall clock to the hash failed the run-to-run
test; hashing the simulation time alone failed the physics-change test.

**Verified locally:** `linux-release` passes 41 of 41, and the sanitized
`linux-debug` passes 41 of 41 in 182 seconds, up from 97; the selftest flights
under the sanitizers are most of the difference.
