### JSBSim, pinned and built, 2026-09-17

**Proved on every platform.** JSBSim builds and the aircraft tests pass in every
preset (CI run 35216463701). The first run (35215481035) failed only in
`windows-clang`: enabling C left that preset with clang-cl for C++ and MSVC for
C, which CMake refuses, and commit `b234322` names clang-cl for both. The
`package` workflow (runs 35215392807 and 35216463589) passed on every platform,
running `glideslope_cli aircraft c172p` out of each unpacked package.

**What exists.** `ext/jsbsim` is JSBSim v1.3.1 (`3b25f25`), built by
`cmake/Jsbsim.cmake` from its `src/` directory only, statically, with its
headers as system headers and the sanitizers applied in the sanitized presets.
The project now enables C as well as C++, for JSBSim's bundled expat.
`ext/README.md` says why each of those choices was made.

- `glideslope_sim` links `libJSBSim`. `glideslope::sim::Aircraft` loads a model
  through `FGFDMExec`, keeping JSBSim's headers out of its own, and reports the
  model's figures. JSBSim's own output is turned off unless `JSBSIM_DEBUG` asks
  for it; it still prints to standard error when a model fails to load.
- `glideslope_platform` is new: `data_directory()` finds `data/` beside the
  running program, through `/proc/self/exe`, `_NSGetExecutablePath` or
  `GetModuleFileNameW`.
- The Cessna 172P's files — `aircraft/c172p/`, `engine/eng_io320.xml` and
  `engine/prop_75in2f.xml` — are copied at configure time into `data/jsbsim/` in
  the build tree, and installed into packages. Which aircraft are copied is a
  CMake list for now, which Phase 5 replaces with data.
- `glideslope_cli aircraft c172p` prints the model's name, description, wing
  area (174.0 sq ft), wingspan (35.8 ft), chord (4.9 ft), empty weight
  (1500.0 lb) and engine count (1). An aircraft with no files exits 1 naming
  it.
- Packages now carry the aircraft data and `licenses/JSBSim.txt`,
  `licenses/expat.txt` and `licenses/GeographicLib.txt`, and nothing else of
  JSBSim's: our install rules are the `glideslope` component, and CPack packages
  that component alone. The `package` workflow now also runs
  `glideslope_cli aircraft c172p` out of each unpacked copy, and checks the
  Linux tarball's licences.

**Tests, 13 now:**

- `the_cli_prints_the_figures_jsbsim_read_from_the_cessna_172_files` — reads
  the wing area, span, chord, empty weight and engine count straight out of
  `c172p.xml`, independently of JSBSim, requires each element's unit to be the
  one the CLI prints in, and compares all five with the CLI's output.
- `the_cli_refuses_an_aircraft_it_has_no_files_for` — exit 1, naming it.

**Watched to fail:** reading wing area from the tail's property failed the
figures test ("the CLI says 21.9, the file says 174"); making the refusal exit
0 failed the refusal test.

**Verified locally:** `linux-release` and the sanitized `linux-debug`, with
JSBSim sanitized too, each pass 13 of 13, with no sanitizer reports. JSBSim
builds in about 19 seconds of wall time. The layering check still passes with
`src/sim/` including JSBSim's headers, and a local package made with
`cpack --preset linux-release` unpacks to a folder whose
`glideslope_cli aircraft c172p` works.
