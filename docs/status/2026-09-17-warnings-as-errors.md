### Warnings as errors, 2026-09-17

**Proved on every compiler.** CI run 35198828479 (commit `d437341`) passed the
test below in every preset: GCC 14.2.0 on Ubuntu, GCC 14.2.1 on Rocky 9,
AppleClang 17.0.0, MSVC 19.51 (narrowing failing as C4244, the sign probe
excluded) and clang-cl 20.1.8 (both probes failing, through the conversion
warnings added for it). Before that run it had been proved with GCC and Clang
only.

`cmake/CompilerWarnings.cmake` gives every first-party target, through
`glideslope_configure`:

- GCC and Clang: `-Wall -Wextra -Wpedantic -Wshadow -Wconversion
  -Wsign-conversion -Wdouble-promotion -Wold-style-cast -Wnon-virtual-dtor
  -Woverloaded-virtual -Wimplicit-fallthrough`, and `-Werror`.
- MSVC: `/W4 /utf-8`, and `/WX`. clang-cl gets the same, plus
  `-Wconversion -Wsign-conversion -Wshadow -Wold-style-cast`, because its
  `/W4` stops at `-Wall -Wextra`.

`GLIDESLOPE_WERROR` defaults to on and is defined in that file, not in
`CMakeLists.txt`, so anything including the file gets the project's default.
Nothing in the flags depends on the build type.

**The test** —
`a_narrowing_or_sign_conversion_fails_the_build_in_every_build_type` —
configures the small project in `tests/warnings/`, which includes the real
`CompilerWarnings.cmake`, with this build's own generator and compiler, once
for each of Debug, Release, RelWithDebInfo and MinSizeRel. In each it builds
three probes: one with explicit casts that must build, one narrowing a double
to a float that must fail naming `float-conversion` (C4244 on MSVC), and one
converting int to unsigned that must fail naming `sign-conversion`. That is 12
probe builds, counted. The sign probe is excluded under MSVC itself, and named
as excluded, because MSVC has no default warning for it.

**Watched to fail, four ways**, locally with GCC 14.3: dropping `-Wconversion`
failed the narrowing probe in all four build types; making `-Werror` apply to
Debug only failed both probes in the other three; dropping `-Wsign-conversion`
failed the sign probe in all four; and a syntax error in the clean probe failed
it in all four.

Verified on Rocky Linux 10: `linux-debug` and `linux-release` with GCC 14.3.1,
and a plain build with Clang 21, each pass 7 of 7 tests, and the project's own
code builds with no warnings under the full set.
