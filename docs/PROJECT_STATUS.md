# Project status

**What this file is.** The single source of truth for what actually works, and
the place detail belongs. `FEATURES.md` says what the simulator should be;
`COMPLETION_PLAN.md` says what order it gets built in and how each item is
verified; this file says what is true *today*, with the gaps named first.

**Never describe a partial module as working.** "Working" means 100% of what it
claims. Anything less is reported with the missing part named *first* — "terrain
streams and draws; nothing collides with it yet", never "terrain works".

## The honest summary, 2026-09-17

**Nothing flies yet.** There is a build, and all it produces is a simulation
library that knows its own version and a command-line tool that prints it. There
is no flight model, no renderer, no terrain and no server.

**Phase 0: 5 of 7 items done** — the build with its presets, CI, the 64-bit
and compiler gates, warnings as errors, and the check that the simulation links
no presentation. Every preset configures, builds and passes its tests on its
own platform in CI. Still to come: packaging, and a final honest pass over these
documents.

## Gaps

Everything in `COMPLETION_PLAN.md`. The ones worth naming first, because they
are the risks the phase order is built around:

- **No flight model.** JSBSim is not pinned or built.
- **No way to set and resume an aircraft's state.** JSBSim has no single
  snapshot and restore call, and client prediction depends on one existing.
- **No terrain.** Neither the Copernicus DEM reader nor the Cesium-to-SDL_GPU
  glue exists.

## Log, newest first

### The simulation links no presentation, 2026-09-17

**Proved on every platform.** CI run 35199507565 (commit `c88b7f0`) passed all
11 tests in every preset, including the binary check reading `otool -L` on
macOS and `dumpbin /dependents` under both MSVC and clang-cl. The check fails
when it finds no dependencies at all, so a pass means each reader understood its
tool's output. Before that run it had been proved on Linux only.

`cmake/Layering.cmake` holds three checks.

**Includes, at configure time.** `glideslope_check_layering` reads every source
under `src/sim/` — `.h .hh .hpp .hxx .inl .ipp .c .cc .cpp .cxx`, recursively —
line by line, and refuses an `#include` of SDL's umbrella or entry-point headers
(3), its video headers (23), its input headers (12) or its audio header, taken
from `include/SDL3` at release-3.4.16, or of anything under `gfx/`, `ui/`,
`platform/` or `frontend/`, with or without leading `../`. The refusal names the
file, the line number and the line, for example
`src/sim/version.cpp:2: #include <SDL3/SDL_gamepad.h>    <- includes SDL
presentation (SDL_gamepad.h)`. SDL's non-presentation headers — threads,
atomics, timers — are not refused by this check. The text is read with `;`,
`[` and `]` swapped out first, because CMake lists split on the first and stop
splitting inside the other two, and C++ is full of all three.

**Links, at configure time.** `glideslope_check_sim_links` walks everything
`glideslope_sim` links — `LINK_LIBRARIES` and `INTERFACE_LINK_LIBRARIES`,
through aliases and `$<LINK_ONLY:...>`, recursively — and refuses any SDL3
target, library name or library file. It is scheduled with
`cmake_language(DEFER)` so a `target_link_libraries` anywhere later in
`CMakeLists.txt` is still seen. This is stricter than the include check: SDL is
one library, and linking any of it links its video, input and audio code.

**The binary, at test time.** `tests/cmake/binary_dependencies.cmake` reads
the dynamic dependencies recorded in `glideslope_cli` itself and refuses any of
26 Linux, 16 macOS or 18 Windows windowing, graphics, input and audio libraries,
SDL included. It fails, rather than passing, if it finds no dependencies at all,
because that means the reader stopped understanding the tool's output. On Linux
today the CLI depends on `libstdc++.so.6`, `libm.so.6`, `libgcc_s.so.1` and
`libc.so.6`.

**Tests:**

- `every_forbidden_include_in_the_simulation_fails_the_configure` — 64 cases,
  derived from the lists and counted: every forbidden SDL header (39); every
  layer as `"layer/x.hpp"`, `"../layer/x.hpp"` and `<layer/x.hpp>` (12); every
  scanned extension (10); a subdirectory, `#  include`, and an include after a
  line holding an unclosed `[` and a `;` (3). Each must be refused naming the
  file, line 3, and the include.
- `includes_that_only_look_like_presentation_are_allowed_in_the_simulation` —
  allowed SDL headers, `sim/` and `world/` headers, `gfxtools/`, `uikit.hpp`,
  `platforms/`, a commented-out forbidden include, one in a block comment, and
  one inside a string, all in one file that must be accepted.
- `sdl_linked_into_the_simulation_by_any_route_fails_the_configure` — 7 cases
  in `tests/layering_link/`: SDL linked directly, through a public dependency,
  through a private one, through an interface library, by plain library name,
  and by file path must each be refused; a simulation linking only non-SDL
  targets must be accepted.
- `the_cli_links_the_simulation_and_nothing_presentational` — the binary check
  on `glideslope_cli`.

**Watched to fail, seven ways.** In the real tree: a
`#include <SDL3/SDL_gamepad.h>` added to `src/sim/version.cpp` stopped the
configure naming `src/sim/version.cpp:2`; a `target_link_libraries` of
`SDL3::SDL3` into `glideslope_sim` appended to the end of `CMakeLists.txt`
stopped it naming the route; and linking the CLI against ALSA failed the binary
test naming `libasound.so.2`. In the checkers: matching only `::SDL3` failed the
library-name and file-path cases; removing the recursion failed the three
indirect cases; removing the `../` normalisation failed all four `../layer`
cases; and removing the `[` escaping failed the unclosed-bracket case.

Verified on Rocky Linux 10 with GCC 14.3.1: `linux-debug` and `linux-release`
each pass 11 of 11 tests, and every configure prints
`src/sim/ includes no presentation (2 files)` and
`glideslope_sim links no SDL`.

### Warnings as errors, 2026-09-17

**Proved on every compiler.** CI run 35198828479 (commit `d437341`) passed the
test below in every preset: GCC 14.2.0 on Ubuntu, GCC 14.2.1 on Rocky 9,
AppleClang 17.0.0, MSVC 19.51 (narrowing failing as C4244, the sign probe
excluded) and clang-cl 20.1.8 (both probes failing, through the conversion
warnings added for it). Before that run it had been proved with GCC and Clang
only.

`cmake/CompilerWarnings.cmake` gives every first-party target, through
`glideslope_configure`:

- GCC and Clang: `-Wall -Wextra -Wpedantic -Wshadow -Wconversion
  -Wsign-conversion -Wdouble-promotion -Wold-style-cast -Wnon-virtual-dtor
  -Woverloaded-virtual -Wimplicit-fallthrough`, and `-Werror`.
- MSVC: `/W4 /utf-8`, and `/WX`. clang-cl gets the same, plus
  `-Wconversion -Wsign-conversion -Wshadow -Wold-style-cast`, because its
  `/W4` stops at `-Wall -Wextra`.

`GLIDESLOPE_WERROR` defaults to on and is defined in that file, not in
`CMakeLists.txt`, so anything including the file gets the project's default.
Nothing in the flags depends on the build type.

**The test** —
`a_narrowing_or_sign_conversion_fails_the_build_in_every_build_type` —
configures the small project in `tests/warnings/`, which includes the real
`CompilerWarnings.cmake`, with this build's own generator and compiler, once
for each of Debug, Release, RelWithDebInfo and MinSizeRel. In each it builds
three probes: one with explicit casts that must build, one narrowing a double
to a float that must fail naming `float-conversion` (C4244 on MSVC), and one
converting int to unsigned that must fail naming `sign-conversion`. That is 12
probe builds, counted. The sign probe is excluded under MSVC itself, and named
as excluded, because MSVC has no default warning for it.

**Watched to fail, four ways**, with GCC 14.3: dropping `-Wconversion` failed
the narrowing probe in all four build types; making `-Werror` apply to Debug
only failed both probes in the other three; dropping `-Wsign-conversion` failed
the sign probe in all four; and a syntax error in the clean probe failed it in
all four.

Verified on Rocky Linux 10: `linux-debug` and `linux-release` with GCC 14.3.1,
and a plain build with Clang 21, each pass 7 of 7 tests, and the project's own
code builds with no warnings under the full set.

**The gates' CI run** (35198316459, commit `7921839`) was green in all four
jobs. In the Rocky 9 job, the system `g++ (GCC) 11.5.0` was refused with
`found: GNU 11.5.0` and `required: GNU 14 or newer`.

### The 64-bit and compiler gates, 2026-09-17

`cmake/Platform.cmake` runs straight after `project()`. It refuses a toolchain
with pointers smaller than 8 bytes, and a compiler older than its floor —
GNU 14, Clang 19 (clang-cl included, which CMake reports as Clang),
AppleClang 16, MSVC 19.39 — with a message naming what it found and what it
needs; for GCC it also says how to enable gcc-toolset-14. A platform outside
Linux x86_64, Windows x64 and macOS arm64, or a compiler with no floor, is
warned about rather than refused. Every configure prints the resolved line, for
example `glideslope: linux-x86_64, GNU 14.3.1 (C++20)`.

The gate is written against `CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME` and does no `try_compile`, so
it runs in CMake script mode against a toolchain described by `-D` flags. That
is how it is tested, because no machine here has a 32-bit toolchain or an old
compiler to hand:

- `a_32_bit_toolchain_is_refused_on_every_platform` — 3 cases: Linux, Windows
  and macOS, each with 4-byte pointers, each refused with "64-bit only" and
  "4-byte pointers" in the output.
- `every_compiler_is_refused_below_its_floor_and_accepted_at_it` — 8 cases,
  derived from the floor table rather than listed in the test: each compiler one
  version below its floor is refused with the found and required versions named,
  and at its floor is accepted with the resolved line printed. The test counts
  the cases it walked against twice the size of the table.

**Watched to fail, four ways.** Relaxing the pointer check to `LESS 4` failed
all three pointer-size cases. Comparing floors with `VERSION_LESS_EQUAL` failed
every at-floor case. Downgrading the refusal to a warning failed every
below-floor case. Adding a compiler to the table with no platform for the test
to run it on failed with "walked 8 cases, expected 10".

**And against a real old compiler:** CI's Rocky 9 job now configures once with
the system's own `g++`, GCC 11, and requires the configure to fail with
"required: GNU 14 or newer" before building with gcc-toolset-14.

The same commit makes the later preset steps in each CI job run even when an
earlier one failed, closing the gap the deliberately red run showed.

Verified on Rocky Linux 10 with GCC 14.3.1: `linux-debug` and `linux-release`
each pass 6 of 6 tests.

### CI, and every preset on its own platform, 2026-09-17

`.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs every preset on the platform it belongs to, and
its first run on `main` (run 35197837005, commit `f5e3890`) was green in all
four jobs, each preset passing 4 of 4 tests:

| Job | Presets | Compiler |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Ubuntu | `linux-debug`, `linux-release` | GCC 14.2.0 |
| Rocky 9 container | `linux-release` | GCC 14.2.1 (gcc-toolset-14) |
| macOS 15 | `macos-debug`, `macos-release` | AppleClang 17.0.0 |
| Windows | `windows-debug`, `windows-release` | MSVC 19.51 |
| Windows | `windows-clang` | clang-cl 20.1.8 |

`linux-debug` also runs only on Ubuntu, not in the Rocky job; the preset is the
same one, and Rocky 9's job exists for the compiler and the distribution.

**CI was watched to fail.** A throwaway branch changed the expected version
string in one test and CI was run on it by hand (run 35198071126): all four
jobs went red, each naming the failed test and the expected string. The branch
was deleted afterwards. That run also showed a gap: a failing preset step
skipped the presets after it in the same job, so a debug failure hid whether
release passed.

`windows-*` steps run under `cmd`, where a failing command does not stop the
script; each command ends in `|| exit /b 1`, which is what made the red run red.

### The build and its presets, 2026-09-17

When this landed, only the Linux presets had run; the macOS and Windows presets
were first run by CI, in the entry above.

**What exists.** A C++20 CMake project, `LANGUAGES CXX` only, with Ninja presets
`linux-debug`, `linux-release`, `macos-debug`, `macos-release`,
`windows-debug`, `windows-release` and `windows-clang`, and a test preset for
each that fails when it finds no tests. C++20 because Cesium Native's own build
requires it.

- `glideslope_sim` — a static library holding `glideslope::sim::version()`,
  which returns the project version compiled in. It is the simulation in name
  only until JSBSim arrives.
- `glideslope_cli` — `--version` prints `glideslope_cli 0.1.0` and exits 0;
  `--help` prints usage to standard output and exits 0; no arguments, or any
  other argument, prints usage to standard error and exits 2.
- The debug presets on Linux and macOS build with
  `-fsanitize=address,undefined -fno-sanitize-recover=all`, from
  `cmake/Sanitizers.cmake`. The no-recover flag is the important one: a small
  signed-overflow program built with GCC 14 without it prints the
  undefined-behaviour report and still exits 0; with it, exits 1.
  `windows-debug` does not sanitize.

**Tests, four, covering every way the CLI can be called today:**
`the_cli_reports_the_project_version`, `the_cli_prints_its_usage_when_asked`,
`the_cli_with_no_arguments_prints_its_usage_and_fails` and
`the_cli_refuses_an_argument_it_does_not_know`. Each runs the CLI through
`tests/cmake/expect_run.cmake`, which checks the exit code *and* the output —
ctest's own `PASS_REGULAR_EXPRESSION` ignores the exit code. Every kind of check
the script makes was watched to fail: a wrong version string, a wrong exit code,
standard error not matching, and standard output not matching each end the
script with an error.

**Verification run.** On Rocky Linux 10 in WSL with GCC 14.3.1, CMake 3.31 and
Ninja 1.11: `linux-debug` and `linux-release` each configure, build and pass
4 of 4 tests. The sanitizer flags appear in every compile command of
`linux-debug` and in none of `linux-release`. The same tree also builds and
passes with Clang 21. `ldd glideslope_cli` lists the C++ runtime, libm, libgcc
and libc, and nothing else.

### The living documents, 2026-09-17

`CLAUDE.md`, `docs/FEATURES.md`, `docs/COMPLETION_PLAN.md`, this file,
`docs/TRANSPORT.md`, `docs/THREATS.md`, `docs/ASSETS.md`, `docs/GUIDE.md`,
`docs/RELEASES.md` and `ext/README.md` now exist, following gearstick's shapes.
The plan's phases are the ones `docs/REQUIREMENTS.md` section 7 starts from,
with the decisions of 2026-09-17 folded into their items. Five tails were
written down on the way: runways on the DEM, free buildings, macOS signing, a
single Linux download, and a hosted public server.

The executables are named `glideslope`, `glideslope_cli` and
`glideslope_server`, after the project as gearstick's are; the brief's
`flightsim_*` names were examples, and `REQUIREMENTS.md` now uses the real ones.

The documents whose subject does not exist yet — the transport, the threat
model, the player's guide, the releases — say so in one paragraph each rather
than describing plans as if they were facts.

The Phase 0 item for these documents stays unticked until the rest of Phase 0
has landed and the documents have been re-read against it.

### Requirements and licence, 2026-09-17

`docs/REQUIREMENTS.md` is the design brief in Markdown, with section 9 recording
the decisions closed and still open. `LICENSE` is the unmodified GPL-3.0 text;
the project is GPL-3.0-or-later.

## Known risks

- **JSBSim state set/resume.** Reconciliation needs to put an instance into a
  full captured state and have it fly on cleanly. Proved or disproved in
  Phase 1, before any networking is built on it.
- **The Cesium-to-SDL_GPU glue.** The biggest rendering risk; Phase 2.
- **Reading the Copernicus DEM directly.** Cesium Native streams only
  quantized-mesh terrain and 3D Tiles, so the open-data provider depends on a
  GeoTIFF reader this project writes; Phase 2.
- **Runway surfaces.** The DEM is a surface model sampled every 30 m, so
  runways carry bumps that are not there. Open in `REQUIREMENTS.md`.
