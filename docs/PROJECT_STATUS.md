# Project status

**What this file is.** The single source of truth for what actually works, and
the place detail belongs. `FEATURES.md` says what the simulator should be;
`COMPLETION_PLAN.md` says what order it gets built in and how each item is
verified; this file says what is true *today*, with the gaps named first.

**Never describe a partial module as working.** "Working" means 100% of what it
claims. Anything less is reported with the missing part named *first* — "terrain
streams and draws; nothing collides with it yet", never "terrain works".

## The honest summary, 2026-09-17

**Nothing flies yet, and nothing builds.** There is no simulation, no renderer,
no server and no build system. The repository holds the requirements, the plan,
the working conventions and these documents, and nothing else.

**Phase 0 has started.** None of its items is ticked.

## Gaps

Everything in `COMPLETION_PLAN.md`. The ones worth naming first, because they
are the risks the phase order is built around:

- **No flight model.** JSBSim is not pinned or built.
- **No way to set and resume an aircraft's state.** JSBSim has no single
  snapshot and restore call, and client prediction depends on one existing.
- **No terrain.** Neither the Copernicus DEM reader nor the Cesium-to-SDL_GPU
  glue exists.

## Log, newest first

### The living documents, 2026-09-17

`CLAUDE.md`, `docs/FEATURES.md`, `docs/COMPLETION_PLAN.md`, this file,
`docs/TRANSPORT.md`, `docs/THREATS.md`, `docs/ASSETS.md`, `docs/GUIDE.md`,
`docs/RELEASES.md` and `ext/README.md` now exist, following gearstick's shapes.
The plan's phases are the ones `docs/REQUIREMENTS.md` section 7 starts from,
with the decisions of 2026-09-17 folded into their items. Five tails were
written down on the way: runways on the DEM, free buildings, macOS signing, a
single Linux download, and a hosted public server.

The executables are named `glideslope`, `glideslope_cli` and
`glideslope_server`, after the project as gearstick's are; the brief's
`flightsim_*` names were examples, and `REQUIREMENTS.md` now uses the real ones.

The documents whose subject does not exist yet — the transport, the threat
model, the player's guide, the releases — say so in one paragraph each rather
than describing plans as if they were facts.

The Phase 0 item for these documents stays unticked until the rest of Phase 0
has landed and the documents have been re-read against it.

### Requirements and licence, 2026-09-17

`docs/REQUIREMENTS.md` is the design brief in Markdown, with section 9 recording
the decisions closed and still open. `LICENSE` is the unmodified GPL-3.0 text;
the project is GPL-3.0-or-later.

## Known risks

- **JSBSim state set/resume.** Reconciliation needs to put an instance into a
  full captured state and have it fly on cleanly. Proved or disproved in
  Phase 1, before any networking is built on it.
- **The Cesium-to-SDL_GPU glue.** The biggest rendering risk; Phase 2.
- **Reading the Copernicus DEM directly.** Cesium Native streams only
  quantized-mesh terrain and 3D Tiles, so the open-data provider depends on a
  GeoTIFF reader this project writes; Phase 2.
- **Runway surfaces.** The DEM is a surface model sampled every 30 m, so
  runways carry bumps that are not there. Open in `REQUIREMENTS.md`.
