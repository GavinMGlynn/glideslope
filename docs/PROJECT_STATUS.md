# Project status

**What this file is.** The single source of truth for what actually works, and
the place detail belongs. `FEATURES.md` says what the simulator should be;
`COMPLETION_PLAN.md` says what order it gets built in and how each item is
verified; this file says what is true *today*, with the gaps named first.

**Never describe a partial module as working.** "Working" means 100% of what it
claims. Anything less is reported with the missing part named *first* — "terrain
streams and draws; nothing collides with it yet", never "terrain works".

## The honest summary, 2026-09-17

**Nothing flies yet.** There is a build, and all it produces is a simulation
library that knows its own version and a command-line tool that prints it. There
is no flight model, no renderer, no terrain and no server.

**Phase 0: 2 of 7 items done** — the build with its presets, and CI. Every
preset configures, builds and passes its tests on its own platform in CI. Still
to come: the 64-bit and compiler gates, warnings as errors, the layering check,
packaging, and a final honest pass over these documents.

## Gaps

Everything in `COMPLETION_PLAN.md`. The ones worth naming first, because they
are the risks the phase order is built around:

- **No flight model.** JSBSim is not pinned or built.
- **No way to set and resume an aircraft's state.** JSBSim has no single
  snapshot and restore call, and client prediction depends on one existing.
- **No terrain.** Neither the Copernicus DEM reader nor the Cesium-to-SDL_GPU
  glue exists.

## Log, newest first

### CI, and every preset on its own platform, 2026-09-17

`.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs every preset on the platform it belongs to, and
its first run on `main` (run 35197837005, commit `f5e3890`) was green in all
four jobs, each preset passing 4 of 4 tests:

| Job | Presets | Compiler |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Ubuntu | `linux-debug`, `linux-release` | GCC 14.2.0 |
| Rocky 9 container | `linux-release` | GCC 14.2.1 (gcc-toolset-14) |
| macOS 15 | `macos-debug`, `macos-release` | AppleClang 17.0.0 |
| Windows | `windows-debug`, `windows-release` | MSVC 19.51 |
| Windows | `windows-clang` | clang-cl 20.1.8 |

`linux-debug` also runs only on Ubuntu, not in the Rocky job; the preset is the
same one, and Rocky 9's job exists for the compiler and the distribution.

**CI was watched to fail.** A throwaway branch changed the expected version
string in one test and CI was run on it by hand (run 35198071126): all four
jobs went red, each naming the failed test and the expected string. The branch
was deleted afterwards. That run also showed a gap: a failing preset step
skipped the presets after it in the same job, so a debug failure hid whether
release passed.

`windows-*` steps run under `cmd`, where a failing command does not stop the
script; each command ends in `|| exit /b 1`, which is what made the red run red.

### The build and its presets, 2026-09-17

When this landed, only the Linux presets had run; the macOS and Windows presets
were first run by CI, in the entry above.

**What exists.** A C++20 CMake project, `LANGUAGES CXX` only, with Ninja presets
`linux-debug`, `linux-release`, `macos-debug`, `macos-release`,
`windows-debug`, `windows-release` and `windows-clang`, and a test preset for
each that fails when it finds no tests. C++20 because Cesium Native's own build
requires it.

- `glideslope_sim` — a static library holding `glideslope::sim::version()`,
  which returns the project version compiled in. It is the simulation in name
  only until JSBSim arrives.
- `glideslope_cli` — `--version` prints `glideslope_cli 0.1.0` and exits 0;
  `--help` prints usage to standard output and exits 0; no arguments, or any
  other argument, prints usage to standard error and exits 2.
- The debug presets on Linux and macOS build with
  `-fsanitize=address,undefined -fno-sanitize-recover=all`, from
  `cmake/Sanitizers.cmake`. The no-recover flag is the important one: a small
  signed-overflow program built with GCC 14 without it prints the
  undefined-behaviour report and still exits 0; with it, exits 1.
  `windows-debug` does not sanitize.

**Tests, four, covering every way the CLI can be called today:**
`the_cli_reports_the_project_version`, `the_cli_prints_its_usage_when_asked`,
`the_cli_with_no_arguments_prints_its_usage_and_fails` and
`the_cli_refuses_an_argument_it_does_not_know`. Each runs the CLI through
`tests/cmake/expect_run.cmake`, which checks the exit code *and* the output —
ctest's own `PASS_REGULAR_EXPRESSION` ignores the exit code. Every kind of check
the script makes was watched to fail: a wrong version string, a wrong exit code,
standard error not matching, and standard output not matching each end the
script with an error.

**Verification run.** On Rocky Linux 10 in WSL with GCC 14.3.1, CMake 3.31 and
Ninja 1.11: `linux-debug` and `linux-release` each configure, build and pass
4 of 4 tests. The sanitizer flags appear in every compile command of
`linux-debug` and in none of `linux-release`. The same tree also builds and
passes with Clang 21. `ldd glideslope_cli` lists the C++ runtime, libm, libgcc
and libc, and nothing else.

### The living documents, 2026-09-17

`CLAUDE.md`, `docs/FEATURES.md`, `docs/COMPLETION_PLAN.md`, this file,
`docs/TRANSPORT.md`, `docs/THREATS.md`, `docs/ASSETS.md`, `docs/GUIDE.md`,
`docs/RELEASES.md` and `ext/README.md` now exist, following gearstick's shapes.
The plan's phases are the ones `docs/REQUIREMENTS.md` section 7 starts from,
with the decisions of 2026-09-17 folded into their items. Five tails were
written down on the way: runways on the DEM, free buildings, macOS signing, a
single Linux download, and a hosted public server.

The executables are named `glideslope`, `glideslope_cli` and
`glideslope_server`, after the project as gearstick's are; the brief's
`flightsim_*` names were examples, and `REQUIREMENTS.md` now uses the real ones.

The documents whose subject does not exist yet — the transport, the threat
model, the player's guide, the releases — say so in one paragraph each rather
than describing plans as if they were facts.

The Phase 0 item for these documents stays unticked until the rest of Phase 0
has landed and the documents have been re-read against it.

### Requirements and licence, 2026-09-17

`docs/REQUIREMENTS.md` is the design brief in Markdown, with section 9 recording
the decisions closed and still open. `LICENSE` is the unmodified GPL-3.0 text;
the project is GPL-3.0-or-later.

## Known risks

- **JSBSim state set/resume.** Reconciliation needs to put an instance into a
  full captured state and have it fly on cleanly. Proved or disproved in
  Phase 1, before any networking is built on it.
- **The Cesium-to-SDL_GPU glue.** The biggest rendering risk; Phase 2.
- **Reading the Copernicus DEM directly.** Cesium Native streams only
  quantized-mesh terrain and 3D Tiles, so the open-data provider depends on a
  GeoTIFF reader this project writes; Phase 2.
- **Runway surfaces.** The DEM is a surface model sampled every 30 m, so
  runways carry bumps that are not there. Open in `REQUIREMENTS.md`.
